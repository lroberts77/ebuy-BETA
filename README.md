## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>

I created this app to get experience working on an ecommerce website. This app fetches data from an api containing various items and displays them on the home page in individual cards containing information about the item. Clicking on an item takes you to a new page displaying the an enlarged item with more detailed information and a button to add to cart. I learned alot during the course of making this app including using redux to store, retrieve and modify state, links with react-router, design using semantic-ui and axios for axios for api interaction.

## <a name="Install">Installation</a>
The deployed live app is [HERE](https://ebuy-beta.netlify.app/)

* Or to clone the repo

## <a name="Usage">Usage</a>
* In the root of the project
```shell
$ npm start
```
If a tab doesn't open with the ebuy-beta app running, open a new tab and type in localhost:3000 in the url bar and press enter. After the page has loaded scroll up and down to view various items, clicking on an item will take you to a page displaying the item with more detailed information
